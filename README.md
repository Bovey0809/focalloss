## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

The project aims to easily study about focal loss.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Python >= 3.6
Pytorch >= 1.3
Numpy
matplotlib
tqdm
tensorboard
sklearn
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.


```
Git clone the repo.
```
```
python train.py
```

tensorboard events will be saved in ./run.

## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Test is nested in "if __name__ == "main". In the future it will be set in unitest framework.

### Break down into end to end tests: Example data.py

```
python data.py
```

### And coding style tests

Following part of Google Python Style.

```
Functions and imports will be seperated even from the same source.
```

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Add your loss function in loss.py or change the network in network.py.

## 🚀 Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

TODO: Import modified focal loss to your project.
